> <h2>Deprecation Notice - EOL January 1st 2025</h2>
>
> As of today, September 27th 2024, reKnag has officially been deprecated. <br><br>
> If you are still using any URLs that were shortened using reKnag (not self-hosted, but the production version on reknag.com), it's suggested that you migrate them to a different URL shortening service. <br>
>
> <strong>URLs shortened using reKnag will stop working on January 1st, 2025 (00:00 EEST).</strong> <br>
> <h3>Reasons: </h3>
> <li>The project wasn't intended for production use</li>
> <li>The method for shortening URLs was less than optimal</li>
> <li>KioydioLabs now works on different, more useful projects.</li>
> <br>
>
> reKnag Lookup has already reached its EOL as of November 25, 2024, and will not be back online. The API endpoint for reverse-lookup of URLs will continue to function until reKnag's EOL. The GitHub repository will remain public and has been archived as of November 25, 2024. The docs will also remain public on https://docs.reknag.com until the domain expires, however they can be found in the repository. The Firefox and Chrome extensions will no longer be on their respective extension stores after December 31, 2024.

> </strong>Thank you to everyone who tried reKnag!</strong>

> [!NOTE]
> We will attempt to get the production version of reknag (reknag.com) archived on the Wayback Machine.
