# How to reverse lookup a URL

To reverse lookup a URL that has been shortened with reKnag, first enter the shortened URL in the URL input field **_(1)_** then click the submit button **_(2)_**.

reKnag Lookup will show you the Original URL **_(4)_** which you can copy by clicking the copy icon **_(3)_**.

If the URL is very long, it will be clipped and ... will show at the end. If you want to see the entire URL click the View Full URL button **_(5)_**.

You can also analyze the original URL with VirusTotal™ by clicking the Analyze on VirusTotal button **_(6)_** which will return a URL you can visit to see the results. That url will appear as "vTotal" below the button **_(7)_**.
