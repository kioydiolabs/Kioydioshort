    <title>Lookup URL</title>
    <p>You can lookup the ID of a shortened URL to check what URL it points to. For example, the shortened URL <code>https://reknag.com/6nbys2</code> has an ID of <code>6nbys2</code>. The ID is the last randomly generated part of the URL. You can lookup the ID to check where this URL points to, in this case it's example.com.</p>
    <p>To make a request to the lookup endpoint simply make an HTTP GET request to the endpoint <code>/lookup/</code> with the <code>id</code> parameter set to the ID (last part) of the shortened URL to lookup.</p>
    <p>The final URL should look like this:</p>
    <code-block lang="http">https://api.reknag.com/lookup/?id=[ID_OF_SHORTENED_URL]</code-block>
    Where:
    <table style="none">
        <tr>
            <td>[ID_OF_SHORTENED_URL]</td>
            <td>The last part of the short URL. For example, in https://reknag.com/6nbys2 it would be 6nbys2<br></br>Note : The ID is always 6 characters long and consists of letters and numbers.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
