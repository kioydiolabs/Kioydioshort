# Frontend

The frontend of Kioydioshort is a simple HTML page styled using CSS.
The webpage uses a simple JavaScript script to make a simple request to the backend API, and return the shortened URL.
There is also a copy button to easily copy the shortened URL that is returned by the JavaScript script.
